## Towards an AI Competence Model for Higher Education

**Workshop Acronym:** AI_Competence

**EC-TEL conference topics addressed:**

- Students' skills and competences
- Fairness, equity, and equality
- Supporting teacher professional development
- Educational technologies

### Description of The Proposed Workshop

Integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education is gaining momentum for use cases including automated grading, personalized learning, and virtual assistants [1, 2, 3]. AI-based tools (ABT) are software programs that use AI to perform various tasks. These tools can analyze data, recognize patterns, and make predictions based on the information they have been trained on. In particular, generative AI became popular with the release of ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer). Concerns are raised that current competencies such as scientific writing or programming are no longer relevant because ChatGPT and other ABT can produce the required content in a short amount of time [4].

The question arises whether there are skills and competencies that the use of ABT in education could strengthen and which not. Additionally, students as well as educators must be equipped with the necessary skills andknowledge to effectively use and analyze results of ABT. In addition to learning technical skills related to AI, users should also be taught to think critically about the implications and ethical considerations of using ABT. This includes understanding issues related to bias, privacy, and security, and developing strategies to mitigate these risks.

The AI_Competencies workshop is organized in the context of the BeLearn research project Bildung 6.0 (Education 6.0), which aims to develop a platform that provides AI-based tools for addressing specific use cases in higher education such as automatic generation of questions for repeating teaching content from PowerPoint slides.

With this interdisciplinary workshop, we aim to bring together experts and practitioners from AI-based tools for higher education focusing on natural language processing, technology-enhanced learning, and educational application of technologies to collect competencies needed by lecturers and students to become able to make sustainable use of ABT.

### Motivation on Why the Workshop is of Particular Interest at This Time

AI has the potential to revolutionize education by providing personalized learning experiences, facilitating student engagement and motivation, and increasing access to education. However, the effective use of AI in education requires a deep understanding of the competencies it is able to strengthen, on the competencies and skills needed to make use of the ABT, and finally, we need an understanding of skills and competencies that are unique to humans and can neither be taught by ABT nor be replaced by ABT.

In this way, the workshop topic is addressing the UN sustainable goal "quality education": When there is a deep understanding of the competencies that ABT can support in teaching, tools can be specifically developed for different target groups. Furthermore, the use of AI in education raises important ethical and social implications related to competencies. Our workshop provides an opportunity to discuss these issues and develop best practices and guidelines to ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically.

### Previous Related Events and Conferences (If Applicable)

Not applicable.

### Workshop Goals

1. Discuss and identify competencies and skills needed for interacting with ABT
2. Discuss and identify competencies and skills where ABT can support in gaining them
3. Develop a learning model or model of competencies for ABT use in higher education

### Expected Outcomes

One or more of the following outputs might be produced in accordance with the participants:

1. Research paper: The workshop could generate new research ideas, hypotheses, or methods related to the use of AI in higher education. These could contribute to scientific papers that add to the scholarly discourse in the field.
2. White paper: The workshop could produce a summary of competencies needed to interact with ABT aggregated in a white paper. This could be useful for future curricula development in higher education.
3. Case studies: The workshop could showcase successful AI-based applications in higher education, the required competencies for responsible interaction and integration in higher education, and the competencies and skills achieved by the application.
4. Draft of an AI competence model

### Expected Participants

We expect to attract the attention of 15-30 participants. The chosen workshop methodology will also allow for more participants to join.

Regarding background, we are open to every conference participant with an interest in future education, in particular, those with knowledge in applying AI-based tools in education settings.

### Maximum Number of Participants

30

### Workshop Format

We are planning an interactive half-day workshop with a maximum of 30 participants. The participants should expect participants should expect: symposia elements, discussion groups, group-based demos, presentations. Before the workshop, we might ask participants to fill out a questionnaire on the topic of the workshop. The results will be used as input for discussion during the workshop.

**Workshop outline:**

- Introduction to AI-based tools for higher education, in which the participants can expect to interact with some AI-based tools
- Facilitated discussion and drafting a list of competencies needed for interacting responsibly with ABTin higher education and also include them responsibly in teaching contexts
- Facilitated discussion and drafting a list of competencies that can be learned by the application of ABT in higher education and those that cannot be learned.

### Expected Workshop Length

Half day

### Preferred Workshop Date

5 September 2023

### Organisational Timeline

Proposed timeline, including a tentative submission deadline for Workshop participants (around late June - early July) and notification date (at least two weeks before the end of the early-bird registration).
